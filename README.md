# Ahk-main
  This autohotkey main helps the user with simple tasks and save you from the trouble of having to switch tabs
## How to use
  To use this script, you must have a numpad and directional keys.
## Keys or shortcuts
  Remember: Some of these hotkeys may mess up some key inputs when using a program
  
  ### Keys that require numlock to be true
      Numpad4-9 = Launch desired program
      (To customize the program the hotkey is going to run, press shift+(numpad4-9) then paste the path of the desired program)
      
      Numpad0 = Runs a custom line of script you can make easily by pressing shift+Numpad0
      
      Numpad2 = Screenshot screen
      
      Numpad3 = Custom notepad
      (Pls Note: I am gonna make a history file in a future update of the script)
      
      There are more things and hotkeys i made however im too lazy to write them today
## Bugs and Gliches
   Currently, moving the custom notepad violently will minimize ALL tabs that are active
## What to do
   - Need to clean up code
   - Need to make it Go BRRR(faster)
   - Make it actually useful(joke)
   - Other stuff im not gonna make or add to the script(Also a joke)
   - yes
Bai now, you are welcome for reading something that wasted ur time
